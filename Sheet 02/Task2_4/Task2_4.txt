Part a) Dictionary Attacks:

1. The RockYou word list is a dictionary for possible passwords. It consists of passwords that were stolen or leaked.
Therefore they seem to be legit to use for cracking passwords.

2. The most passwords are made up only from standart characters and are quite short. Some of them (the most) are chosen sloppy
and are normal words or a combination of two words. In many cases using a regular library as a word list would be enough.

3. a "strong" password is a long password consisting of different charakters out of different charactersets without formin
a regular word.

a "weak" password is short and does use only a single or few charactersets.

4. No its not.

Part b) Brute-Force Attacks:

The number of possible passwords is P^n so that increasing the length of the password n causes the number of possible passwords
to grow faster.

A password with length 5 and P = U + L has about 254 million possible combinations.
Adding D to P makes it about 656 million possibilities.

Having P = U + L again and increase n by one (|P| = 48 and n = 6) increases the amount of possible passwords to
12 billion.
