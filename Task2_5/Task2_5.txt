the pcap file contains a record of network packets during a network communication.

The target seems to be a website or web application where it is mandatory to login.

The attacker is using a sql injection trying to get user information.

No, the attack did not ultimately compromis the target system. Therefore the leaked information must be used to get access to the System.
Furthermore the attacker was not successfull i think. Usernames were leaked but the passwords not.

Securing the system from user input is mandatory to be safe from sql injections.
